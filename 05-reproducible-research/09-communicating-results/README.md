#### Questions and Answers:


What are the main concerns when communicating project results?

- Large projects generate lots of details: data/files/methods/deadends.

- How to present hierarchically, starting with broad high-level details, then gradually increasing granularity?
- First cuts are often presented via email, then as writeup or orally.
