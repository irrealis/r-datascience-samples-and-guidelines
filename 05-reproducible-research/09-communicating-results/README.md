#### Questions and Answers:


What are the main concerns when communicating project results?

- Large projects generate lots of details: data/files/methods/deadends.
- People are busy and usually lack time to absorb all details.
- How to present hierarchically, starting with broad high-level details, then gradually increasing granularity?
- First cuts are often presented via email, then as writeup or orally.



What are the "SI" rules for getting email reponses from busy (Successful/Important) people?

- Try to limit to one email per day.
- Try to limit email to three sentences.
    - Better: fit entire email into subject line.
- Try to stick to yes/no questions.
    - Avoid questions requiring full-sentence responses.
- Try to be as specific as possible while conforming to the above.
- For time-sensitive topics, state default actions you'll take, and when.
- Bonus: include obvious search times for later locating your email.
