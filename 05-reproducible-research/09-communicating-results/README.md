#### Questions and Answers:


What are the main concerns when communicating project results?

- Large projects generate lots of details: data/files/methods/deadends.
- People are busy and usually lack time to absorb all details.
- How to present hierarchically, starting with broad high-level details, then gradually increasing granularity?
- First cuts are often presented via email, then as writeup or orally.



What are the "SI" rules for getting email reponses from busy (Successful/Important) people?

- Try to limit to one email per day.
- Try to limit email to three sentences.
    - Better: fit entire email into subject line.
- Try to stick to yes/no questions.
    - Avoid questions requiring full-sentence responses.
- Try to be as specific as possible while conforming to the above.
- For time-sensitive topics, state default actions you'll take, and when.
- Bonus: include obvious search times for later locating your email.



What is a good general hierarchy for email presentations?

- Subject line is mandatory. Try to summarize findings in one sentence.

- Body:
    - Brief description, 1-2 paragraphs, of problem/context, and summarizing findings/results.
    - If action must be taken, suggest options as concretely as possible.
    - If questions must be answered, try to make them yes/no.

- Attachments:
    - Be concise.
    - Try to generate from literate markup.

- Links to any supplementary materials:
    - Code/software/data.
    - Github repos or project websites.
