#### Questions and Answers:


'Overview'
What are the typical steps of a data analysis?

- Define the question.
- Define the ideal data set.
- Determine what data you can obtain.
- Obtain the data.
- Clean the data.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Statistical prediction/modeling.
- Interpret results.
- Challenge results.
- Synthesize/write up results.
- Create reproducible code.



What characterizes good questions for data analyis?

- Science generally determines the questions.
- The questions are focused and concrete.
- The questions lead to required data.
- Required data lead to applied statistics.



What are the benefits of focused, concrete questions for data analysis?

- They allow identifying/discarding data/variables that aren't pertinent.
    - This reduces noise in subsequent analyses.
- They reduce the search space for finding answers.



What characterizes the ideal dataset for your data analysis?

Depends on your goal.

- Descriptive analysis: requires an entire population.
- Exploratory analysis: requires a random sample measuring many variables.
- Inferential analysis: requires a random sample of the right population.
    - Requires carefully-selected population.
    - Requires carefully-selected sampling method.
- Predictive: requires training and testing subsets from the same population.- Causal: requires experimental data from a randomized study.
- Mechanistic: requires data about all components of the system.
