'Overview'
What are the typical steps of a data analysis?

- Define the question.
- Define the ideal data set.
- Determine what data you can obtain.
- Obtain the data.
- Clean the data.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Statistical prediction/modeling.

- Create reproducible code.



What characterizes good questions for data analyis?

- Science generally determines the questions.
- The questions are focused and concrete.
- The questions lead to required data.
- Required data lead to applied statistics.



What are the benefits of focused, concrete questions for data analysis?

- They allow identifying/discarding data/variables that aren't pertinent.
    - This reduces noise in subsequent analyses.
- They reduce the search space for finding answers.
