### 01 Principles of Analytic Graphics
#### Questions and Answers:

What are the basic principles of analytic graphics?  
1. Show comparisons.
2. Explore relationships.
3. Tease out and show confounders.
4. Show multivariate data.
5. Integrate related evidence.
6. Document evidence and graphics.
7. Content is king.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "show comparisons".  
Provide and compare graphics for various treatments/conditions, e.g. experimental vs. control.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "explore relationships".  
(Use graphical comparisons to...) suggest potential causality, mechanisms, or other explanations of potential relationships between variables under various treatments or conditions.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "tease out and show confounders".  
(Try to...) explain spurious correlations between related variables using confounders.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "show multivariate data".  
Show as many variables in a graphic as you reasonably can to help visualize/compare relationships between variables.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "integrate related evidence".  
To aid visualizing/comparing relationships between variables, avoid putting related graphics/tables in different parts of a presentation/paper.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, to "document evidence and graphics".
To make the analysis easy to understand: use clear labels/scales; reference data sources; provide or link to raw data, tidy data, and source code used to generate graphics and tidy data.

Describe the principle of analytic graphics, that "content is king".  
Interesting stories, analyses, and presentations require data credibility, integrity, quality, relevance.
- Credibility: believability of data source.
- Integrity: how well the raw data is preserved.
- Quality: how well the tidy data meets the needs of the required analysis.
- Relevance: how well the data analysis answers your questions.
