‘mgp’ The margin line (in ‘mex’ units) for the axis title, axis
     labels and axis line.  Note that ‘mgp[1]’ affects ‘title’
     whereas ‘mgp[2:3]’ affect ‘axis’.  The default is ‘c(3, 1,
     0)’.

‘mkh’ The height in inches of symbols to be drawn when the value
     of ‘pch’ is an integer. _Completely ignored in R_.

‘new’ logical, defaulting to ‘FALSE’.  If set to ‘TRUE’, the next
     high-level plotting command (actually ‘plot.new’) should _not
     clean_ the frame before drawing _as if it were on a *_new_*
     device_.  It is an error (ignored with a warning) to try to
     use ‘new = TRUE’ on a device that does not currently contain
     a high-level plot.

‘oma’ A vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’ giving
     the size of the outer margins in lines of text.

‘omd’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the region
     _inside_ outer margins in NDC (= normalized device
     coordinates), i.e., as a fraction (in [0, 1]) of the device
     region.

‘omi’ A vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’ giving
     the size of the outer margins in inches.

‘page’ _*R.O.*_; A boolean value indicating whether the next call
     to ‘plot.new’ is going to start a new page.  This value may
     be ‘FALSE’ if there are multiple figures on the page.

‘pch’ Either an integer specifying a symbol or a single character
     to be used as the default in plotting points.  See ‘points’
     for possible values and their interpretation.  Note that only
     integers and single-character strings can be set as a
     graphics parameter (and not ‘NA’ nor ‘NULL’).

     Some functions such as ‘points’ accept a vector of values
     which are recycled.

‘pin’ The current plot dimensions, ‘(width, height)’, in inches.

‘plt’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the
     coordinates of the plot region as fractions of the current
     figure region.

‘ps’ integer; the point size of text (but not symbols).  Unlike
     the ‘pointsize’ argument of most devices, this does not
     change the relationship between ‘mar’ and ‘mai’ (nor ‘oma’
     and ‘omi’).

     What is meant by ‘point size’ is device-specific, but most
     devices mean a multiple of 1bp, that is 1/72 of an inch.

‘pty’ A character specifying the type of plot region to be used;
     ‘"s"’ generates a square plotting region and ‘"m"’ generates
     the maximal plotting region.

‘smo’ (_Unimplemented_) a value which indicates how smooth circles
     and circular arcs should be.

‘srt’ The string rotation in degrees.  See the comment about
     ‘crt’.  Only supported by ‘text’.

‘tck’ The length of tick marks as a fraction of the smaller of the
     width or height of the plotting region.  If ‘tck >= 0.5’ it
     is interpreted as a fraction of the relevant side, so if ‘tck
     = 1’ grid lines are drawn.  The default setting (‘tck = NA’)
     is to use ‘tcl = -0.5’.

‘tcl’ The length of tick marks as a fraction of the height of a
     line of text.  The default value is ‘-0.5’; setting ‘tcl =
     NA’ sets ‘tck = -0.01’ which is S' default.

‘usr’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the extremes
     of the user coordinates of the plotting region.  When a
     logarithmic scale is in use (i.e., ‘par("xlog")’ is true, see
     below), then the x-limits will be ‘10 ^ par("usr")[1:2]’.
     Similarly for the y-axis.

‘xaxp’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, n)’ giving the coordinates
     of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals between
     tick-marks when ‘par("xlog")’ is false.  Otherwise, when
     _log_ coordinates are active, the three values have a
     different meaning: For a small range, ‘n’ is _negative_, and
     the ticks are as in the linear case, otherwise, ‘n’ is in
     ‘1:3’, specifying a case number, and ‘x1’ and ‘x2’ are the
     lowest and highest power of 10 inside the user coordinates,
     ‘10 ^ par("usr")[1:2]’. (The ‘"usr"’ coordinates are
     log10-transformed here!)

     n = 1 will produce tick marks at 10^j for integer j,

     n = 2 gives marks k 10^j with k in {1,5},

     n = 3 gives marks k 10^j with k in {1,2,5}.

     See ‘axTicks()’ for a pure R implementation of this.

     This parameter is reset when a user coordinate system is set
     up, for example by starting a new page or by calling
     ‘plot.window’ or setting ‘par("usr")’: ‘n’ is taken from
     ‘par("lab")’.  It affects the default behaviour of subsequent
     calls to ‘axis’ for sides 1 or 3.

     It is only relevant to default numeric axis systems, and not
     for example to dates.

‘xaxs’ The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the
     x-axis.  Possible values are ‘"r"’, ‘"i"’, ‘"e"’, ‘"s"’,
     ‘"d"’.  The styles are generally controlled by the range of
     data or ‘xlim’, if given.
     Style ‘"r"’ (regular) first extends the data range by 4
     percent at each end and then finds an axis with pretty labels
     that fits within the extended range.
     Style ‘"i"’ (internal) just finds an axis with pretty labels
     that fits within the original data range.
     Style ‘"s"’ (standard) finds an axis with pretty labels
     within which the original data range fits.
     Style ‘"e"’ (extended) is like style ‘"s"’, except that it is
     also ensures that there is room for plotting symbols within
     the bounding box.
     Style ‘"d"’ (direct) specifies that the current axis should
     be used on subsequent plots.
     (_Only ‘"r"’ and ‘"i"’ styles have been implemented in R._)

‘xaxt’ A character which specifies the x axis type.  Specifying
     ‘"n"’ suppresses plotting of the axis.  The standard value is
     ‘"s"’: for compatibility with S values ‘"l"’ and ‘"t"’ are
     accepted but are equivalent to ‘"s"’: any value other than
     ‘"n"’ implies plotting.

‘xlog’ A logical value (see ‘log’ in ‘plot.default’).  If ‘TRUE’,
     a logarithmic scale is in use (e.g., after ‘plot(*, log =
     "x")’).  For a new device, it defaults to ‘FALSE’, i.e.,
     linear scale.

‘xpd’ A logical value or ‘NA’.  If ‘FALSE’, all plotting is
     clipped to the plot region, if ‘TRUE’, all plotting is
     clipped to the figure region, and if ‘NA’, all plotting is
     clipped to the device region.  See also ‘clip’.

‘yaxp’ A vector of the form ‘c(y1, y2, n)’ giving the coordinates
     of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals between
     tick-marks unless for log coordinates, see ‘xaxp’ above.

‘yaxs’ The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the
     y-axis.  See ‘xaxs’ above.

‘yaxt’ A character which specifies the y axis type.  Specifying
     ‘"n"’ suppresses plotting.

‘ylbias’ A positive real value used in the positioning of text in
     the margins by ‘axis’ and ‘mtext’.  The default is in
     principle device-specific, but currently ‘0.2’ for all of R's
     own devices.  Set this to ‘0.2’ for compatibility with R <
     2.14.0 on ‘x11’ and ‘windows()’ devices.

‘ylog’ A logical value; see ‘xlog’ above.
